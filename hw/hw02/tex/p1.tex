\begin{problem}
  Exercise 5.2 in Nocedal and Wright.

  Show that if the nonzero vectors $p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_l$ satisfy
  
  \[p_i\transpose A p_{j} = 0, \textnormal{ for all } i \ne j\text{,}\]
  
  \noindent
  where $A$ is symmetric and positive definite, then these vectors are linearly independent. (This result implies that $A$ has at most $n$ conjugate directions.)
