\begin{problem}
  In this problem we will test the performance of linear conjugate gradient method for minimizing quadratic function $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x\transpose Ax - b \transpose x$, where $A$ is symmetric and positive definite.
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Program CG Algorithm~5.2 in the textbook.
    
    \item Apply your program on a symmetric and positive definite matrix $A$ of dimension $10^{3} \times 10^{3}$ with eigenvalues uniformly distributed between~$10$ and~$10^3$. Test the convergence of the algorithm and compare your numerical findings with the theoretical result shown in formula (5.36) in the textbook.
    
    \item Change the distribution of eigenvalues of $A$ so that some eigenvalues are distributed between 9~and~11, the rest of eigenvalues are distributed between 999 and 1001, i.e.,~two clusters around 10~and~1000 with radius~1. Test the convergence performance on such matrix. Extra points if you can explain your numerical findings using the theoretical convergence results discussed in the lecture.
  \end{itemize}
