\begin{problem}
  Exercise 3.6 in Nocedal and Wright.
  
  Consider the steepest descent method with exact line searches applied to the convex quadratic function~(3.24). Using the properties given in this chapter, show that if the initial point is such that ${x_0 - x^{*}}$ is parallel to an eigenvector of $Q$, then the steepest descent method will find the solution in one step.
