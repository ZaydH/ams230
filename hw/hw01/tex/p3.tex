\begin{problem}
  Exercise 3.6 in Nocedal and Wright.
  
  Consider the steepest descent method with exact line searches applied to the convex quadratic function~(3.24). Using the properties given in this chapter, show that if the initial point is such that ${x_0 - x^{*}}$ is parallel to an eigenvector of $Q$, then the steepest descent method will find the solution in one step.
\end{problem}

The convex, quadratic cost function (3.24) is defined as:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x\transpose Q x - b\transpose x \textrm{.} \]

\noindent
The gradient and Hessian of this function are 

\[ \nabla f = Q x - b  \]

\noindent
and

\[ \nabla^2 f = Q \]

\noindent
respectively.
