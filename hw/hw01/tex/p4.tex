\begin{problem}
  Consider the steepest descent method with exact line searches pplied to the convex quadratic function $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x\transpose Q x$, where $Q$ is symmetric and positive definite.  Show that the search direction at step $k+1$ is always orthogonal to the search direction at step~$k$, i.e.,~$p_{k}p_{k+1} = 0$ for all $k$.
