\begin{problem}
  Consider the steepest descent method with exact line searches applied to the convex quadratic function $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x\transpose Q x - b\transpose x$, where $Q$ is symmetric and positive definite.  Show that the search direction at step $k+1$ is always orthogonal to the search direction at step~$k$, i.e.,~$p_{k}\transpose p_{k+1} = 0$ for all $k$.
\end{problem}

\noindent
In exact line search, the step size $\alpha$ is chosen such that:

\[ \alpha_k = \arg \min_{\alpha} f(x_k + \alpha p_k)\textrm{.} \]

\noindent
Therefore, taking the derivative of $f_{k+1}$ with respect to $\alpha$ yields:

\[ \frac{\partial f_{k+1}}{\partial \alpha_{k}} = 0 \textrm{.} \]

\noindent
By the chain rule, this becomes,

\[ \frac{\partial f_{k+1}}{\partial x_{k+1}} \cdot \frac{\partial x_{k+1}}{\partial \alpha_{k}} = 0 \textrm{.} \]

\noindent
Knowing that ${x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha_{k} p_k}$, we can rearrange the terms to prove the required statement:

\begin{aligncustom}
  \nabla\transpose f_{k+1} p_k &= 0 \\
  p_{k+1}\transpose p_k &= 0 \\
  p_{k}\transpose p_{k+1} &= 0\textrm{.}
\end{aligncustom}
