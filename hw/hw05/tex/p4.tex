  Exercise~12.17 in Nocedal and Wright.
  
  Prove that when the KKT conditions (12.34) and the LICQ are satisfied at a given point $\xopt$, the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda^{*}$ in (12.34) is unique.
\end{problem}

By the first KKT condition, it holds that:

\[ \nabla \mathcal{L}(\xopt \lopt) = \nabla f - \sum_I \lopt_i \nabla c_i(\xopt) = 0 \text{.}\]

\noindent
This can be rewritten as a matrix equation as shown below:

\begin{aligncustom}
  \sum_i \lopt_i \nabla c_i(\xopt) &= \nabla f \\
  \left[\nabla c_1(\xopt)~\cdots~\nabla c_k(\xopt)\right] [\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_k]\transpose &= \nabla f \text{.}
\end{aligncustom}

\noindent
Since the constraint gradients are linearly independent by LICQ property, then matrix ${\left[\nabla c_1(\xopt)~\cdots~\nabla c_k(\xopt)\right]}$ is invertible.  By the Invertible Matrix Theorem, the solution for ${[\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_k]\transpose}$ is unique making all of the Lagrange multipliers unique.
