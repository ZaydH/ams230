  Exercise~12.18 in Nocedal and Wright.
  
  Consider the problem of finding the point on the parabola $y=\frac{1}{5}(x-1)^{2}$ that is closest to $(x,y)=(1,2)$ in the Euclidian norm sense.  We can formulate this problem as:
  
  \[\min f(x,y)=(x-1)^2  + (y-2)^2 ~~~~~~ \text{subject to } (x-1)^2 = 5y \text{.} \]
\end{problem}

\begin{subproblem}
  Find all the KKT points for this problem.  Is the LICQ satisfied?
\end{subproblem}

\begin{subproblem}
  Which of these points are solutions?
\end{subproblem}

\begin{subproblem}
  By directly substituting the constraint into the objective function and eliminating the variable~$x$, we obtain an unconstrained optimization problem.  Show that the solutions of this problem cannot be solutions to the original problem.
\end{subproblem}
