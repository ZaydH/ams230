  Exercise~12.18 in Nocedal and Wright.
  
  Consider the problem of finding the point on the parabola $y=\frac{1}{5}(x-1)^{2}$ that is closest to $(x,y)=(1,2)$ in the Euclidian norm sense.  We can formulate this problem as:
  
  \[\min f(x,y)=(x-1)^2  + (y-2)^2 ~~~~~~ \text{subject to } (x-1)^2 = 5y \text{.} \]
\end{problem}

The gradient of $f$ is:

\[\nabla f =  \begin{bmatrix}
                2(x-1)\\
                2(y-2)
              \end{bmatrix} \text{.}\]

\noindent
Rewrite $c_1(x,y)=(x-1)^2-5y=0$.  Its gradient is:

\[\nabla c_1 =  \begin{bmatrix}
                  2(x-1)\\
                  -5
                \end{bmatrix} \text{.}\]

\begin{subproblem}
  Find all the KKT points for this problem.  Is the LICQ satisfied?
\end{subproblem}

Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda$ only holds when $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla c_1$.  In the case of the first dimension, $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla c_1$.  There are two possible cases:

\noindent
\textit{Case~\#1}: $\lambda=1$.  This means $2(y-2)=-5$ making $y=-1/2$.  Clearly, this is not possible so we can drop this case.

\noindent
\text{Case~\#2}: $x=1$.  This makes $y=0$ and $\lambda=4/5$.

\begin{subproblem}
  Which of these points are solutions?
\end{subproblem}

\begin{subproblem}
  By directly substituting the constraint into the objective function and eliminating the variable~$x$, we obtain an unconstrained optimization problem.  Show that the solutions of this problem cannot be solutions to the original problem.
