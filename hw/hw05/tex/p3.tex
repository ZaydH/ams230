\begin{problem}\label{prob:03}%%
  Exercise~12.14 in Nocedal and Wright (assume that $a$ is not a zero vector).
  
  Consider the half space defined by $H=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^n \vert a\transpose x + \alpha \geq 0 \}$ where $a\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ are given.  Formulate and solve the optimization problem for finding the point $x$ in $H$ that has the smallest Euclidian norm.
\end{problem}

This can be framed as the constrained optimization problem below.

\[ \min \norm{x} \text{ s.t. } a\transpose x + \alpha \ge 0 \text{.}\]
