\begin{problem}\label{prob:02}%%
  Exercise~12.5 in Nocedal and Wright.
  
  Let $v:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a smooth vector function, and consider the unconstrained optimization problems of minimizing $f(x)$ where
  
  \[f(x)=\norm{v(x)}_{\infty}~~~~~~~f(x)=\max_{i=1,2,\ldots,m}v_i(x)\text{.}\]
  
  \noindent
  Reformulate these (generally nonsmooth) problems as smooth constrained optimization problems.
