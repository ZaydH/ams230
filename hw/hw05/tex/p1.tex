  Exercise~11.2 in Nocedal and Wright.
  
  \noindent
  Consider the function $r:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $r(x)=x^{q}$, where $q$ is an integer greater than~2.  Note that ${\xopt = 0}$ is the sole root of this function and that it is degenerate.  Show that Newton's method converges Q-linearly, and find the value of the convergence ratio $r$ in (A.34)
  
  \[\frac{\norm{x_{k+1}-\xopt}}{\norm{x_k-\xopt}} \le r,~~~~\text{for all $k$ sufficiently large}  \text{.}\]
