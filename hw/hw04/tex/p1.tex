  Exercise~6.1 in Nocedal and Wright.



  \textbf{Hint}: \textnormal{If a function $f(x)$ is strongly convex, there exists $\sigma > 0$ such that $v\transpose \nabla^{2}f(x) v \geq \sigma \norm{v}^2$.}
\end{problem}

\begin{subproblem}
  Show that if $f$ is strongly convex, then

  \[ s_{k}\transpose y_k > 0 \]

  \vspace{-1em}
  holds for any vectors $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$.
\end{subproblem}

\begin{proof}
  A function,~$f$, is \textit{strongly convex} if it holds that:

  \[\bigg(\nabla f(x) - \nabla f(y)\bigg)\transpose (x-y) \geq m \norm{x-y}^2 \]

  \noindent
  for some $m>0$.  Define $s_k=x_{k+1}-x_k$ as the change in position between consecutive iterates.  Define $y_k = \nabla f_{k+1} - \nabla f_k$. Given a strongly convex $f(x)$, we get:

  \[y_k\transpose s_k \geq m \norm{s_k}^2 \text{.}\]

  \noindent
  If $x_k \neq x_{k+1}$, then by definition $\norm{s_k}>0$. Also, $y_k\transpose s_k = s_k\transpose y_k$.  Therefore,

  \[s_k\transpose y_k >0 \text{.} \]
\end{proof}

\begin{subproblem}
  Give an example of a function of one variable satisfying $g(0)=-1$ and $g(1)=-\frac{1}{4}$ and show that (6.7) does not hold in this case.
\end{subproblem}

Consider the univariate function $f(x) =\frac{1}{x+1}$ whose gradient $\nabla f(x) = g(x)= -\frac{1}{(x+1)^2}$.  This function is obviously not convex, but its gradient satisfies the property that $g(0)=-1$ and $g(1) = -0.25$. Consider $x_1 = -2$ and $x_2 = 0$.  $g(x_1) = g(x_2) = -1$ making 

\[s\transpose y = 0 \text{.} \]

\noindent
Clearly, this does not satisfy the above condition that $s\transpose y >0$.
