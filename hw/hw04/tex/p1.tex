\begin{problem}\label{prob:01}%%
  Exercise~6.1 in Nocedal and Wright. 
  
  
  
  \textbf{Hint}: \textnormal{If a function $f(x)$ is strongly convex, there exists $\sigma > 0$ such that $v\transpose \nabla^{2}f(x) v \geq \sigma \norm{v}^2$.}
\end{problem}

\begin{subproblem}
  Show that if $f$ is strongly convex, then
  
  \[ s_{k}\transpose y_k > 0 \]

  \vspace{-1em}
  holds for any vectors $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$.
\end{subproblem}

Define $s_k=x_{k+1}-x_k$ as the change in position between consecutive iterates.  Since $x_{k+1}=x_k + \alpha_k p_k$, $s_k = \alpha_k p_k$.  Next, define $y_k = \nabla f_{k+1} - \nabla f_k$.  Using the definition of $m_{k+1}$, we see that $y_k = B_{k+1}s_k=B_{k+1}\alpha_k p_k$.  Therefore,

\[ s_k\transpose y_k = (\alpha_k p_k)\transpose B_{k+1} \alpha_k p_k = c p_k\transpose B_{k+1} p_k\text{.} \]


\begin{subproblem}
  Give an example of a function of one variable satisfying $g(0)=-1$ and $g(1)=-\frac{1}{4}$ and show that (6.7) does not hold in this case.
\end{subproblem}

Consider the simple univariate function $f(x) =\frac{1}{x+1}$ whose gradient $\nabla f(x) = g(x)= \frac{-1}{(x+1)^2}$.  This function is not obviously convex, but its gradient satisfies the property that $g(0)=-1$ and $g(1) = -0.25$. Substituting into the above, we get:
